              </h2>
              <p className="my-4 font-medium cursor-default">
                I&apos;m a full-stack web developer with a strong passion for
                building scalable and user-centric applications that solve
                real-world problems. With hands-on experience using PHP and
                JavaScript, I&apos;ve developed both frontend and backend
                systemsâ€”from responsive interfaces to robust server-side logic.
                I take pride in creating clean, maintainable code and designing
                systems that prioritize performance, efficiency, and user
                experience. I&apos;ve contributed to impactful projects
                including integrated platforms and AI-powered solutions that
                improved operational workflows for businesses.
              </p>
              <p className="my-4 font-medium cursor-default">
                As a detail-oriented developer, I enjoy tackling technical
                challenges and continuously refining my skills. I believe that
                great development comes from a balance of logic, creativity, and
                constant learning. Whether it&apos;s exploring new frameworks,
                optimizing existing architecture, or automating complex
                processes, I&apos;m always eager to push boundaries and deliver
                results. My goal is not just to write code, but to build
                solutions that truly make a difference.
